            <p>
              The Great Salt Lake, a natural wonder located in Utah, USA, is
              facing an unprecedented crisis. Once one of the largest saltwater
              lakes in the world, it has been shrinking at an alarming rate. The
              culprits? A combination of climate change, which is causing
              reduced snowfall and increased evaporation; water diversion for
              agricultural and urban use, depleting its tributaries; and human
              activities like mineral extraction. This decline not only
              threatens the unique ecosystem of the lake but also has
              far-reaching implications for the local economy and quality of
              life.
